# Text--Summariser
In this Python project, I used natural language processing (NLP) to summarise information from a Wikipedia page.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a subfield called text summarization that works with obtaining summaries from massive amounts of text. NLP-based approaches and deep learning-based techniques are the two primary categories of text summarising techniques. I employed a straightforward NLP-based text summarising method in this research. In writing this post, I didn't utilise any machine learning libraries. Instead, I just used the NLTK package in Python to summarise Wikipedia articles.
